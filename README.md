# supabase-discussion-tracker

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app). This project uses the [Github GraphQL API](https://docs.github.com/en/graphql) to query the comments on the [Supabase discussion](https://github.com/supabase/supabase/discussions/6979)

## Why was this created?

I like, many others, have been upvoting a [specific feature](https://github.com/supabase/supabase/discussions/6979) that we would like [Supabase](https://supabase.com) to implement. 

I was bored one day and noticed how many people have been upvoting the discussion. So I figured I'd make this website. Enjoy.
